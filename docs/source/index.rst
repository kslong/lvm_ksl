lvm_ksl documentation
#####################

Knox Long has created a series of routines for use with lvm data. The 
routines are intended both for science analysis and for use in developing
better softwared (associated largely with sky subtraction) for reducint
the data.

This documentation is primarly for his own use, but others will hopefull find 
the package and the documeantion useful as well.  Note that some of the routines
are well developed in the sense that Knox has used them multiple times and some
are experimwenatls.  Those that have detailed documantion are the most reliable.
