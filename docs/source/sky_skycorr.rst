Sky Subtraction with SkyCorr
============================

This page is part of :doc:`sky_subtraction`.

ESO's SkyCorr is a tool for sky subtraction that can handle cases where
the sky varies spatially or temporally. The following scripts provide
an interface to SkyCorr for LVM data.


Prep4SkyCorr.py
---------------

Prepares LVM CFrame data for use with SkyCorr by extracting mean spectra
from science and sky fibers into a format SkyCorr can read.

**Usage**::

    Prep4SkyCorr.py [-h] [-dir whatever] [-all] filename1 filename2 ...

**Options:**

-h
    Print help and exit.

-dir path
    Search for files in the specified directory.

-all
    Process all lvmCFrame files in the directory.

**Output:**

Creates FITS files with mean spectra suitable for SkyCorr input.

RunSkyCorr.py
-------------

Runs the ESO SkyCorr tool on prepared input files.

**Usage**::

    RunSkyCorr.py sci.fits sky.fits

where ``sci.fits`` is the science spectrum and ``sky.fits`` is the sky
spectrum (both prepared by Prep4SkyCorr.py).

**Requirements:**

1. SkyCorr must be installed and the ``skycorr`` executable in your PATH
2. A parameter file ``lvm_base.par`` must exist in the working directory

**Setup:**

On first run, if ``lvm_base.par`` does not exist, the script will create
a template. You must edit this file to set the correct paths::

    INST_DIR=/path/to/skycorr/installation/
    INPUT_OBJECT_SPECTRUM=/path/to/data/XXOBJECT.fits
    INPUT_SKY_SPECTRUM=/path/to/data/XXSKY.fits
    OUTPUT_DIR=/path/to/output/

Note: SkyCorr requires absolute paths. The placeholders XXOBJECT and
XXSKY are replaced automatically by the script.

SkySub.py
---------

Performs simple sky subtraction by scaling the sky spectrum to match
the science spectrum and subtracting.

**Usage**::

    SkySub.py filename

This provides a quick alternative to the DRP sky subtraction for testing
purposes. The scaling factor is determined by minimizing residuals in
regions dominated by sky emission.


Typical Workflow
----------------

1. Start with CFrame files (before DRP sky subtraction)
2. Prepare files for SkyCorr::

       Prep4SkyCorr.py lvmCFrame-00012345.fits

3. Run SkyCorr::

       RunSkyCorr.py sci_mean.fits sky_mean.fits

4. Compare results with DRP sky subtraction
